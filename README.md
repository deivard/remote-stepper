# remote-stepper
MicroPython based web socket server controlling a stepper motor remotely with arrow keys on your keyboard. 

(This was the basis for a remote controlled cat toy that would get the cat to bother something else other than me, at a location far away from me. The cat still prefers to bother me.)
